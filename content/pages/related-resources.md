All of the works published in *Angles* since its first edition in 2008 were written by students in the introductory writing courses at MIT. These courses, designated as CI-HW![](/images/educator/icon-question-cihw.png) subjects, bring together students who love to write, students who struggle with writing, students who thrive in seminar-style classes, and students who just want a chance to develop their English skills. These students prosper together and produce some remarkable work. *Angles* has provided them with a public outlet for that work. It also provides the CI-HW instructors with material that inspires and guides their current students.

A unique student-run magazine featuring the international development experiences of MIT students. Our publication presents these stories with a bright design, an informal style, and ample amounts of eye-catching photos. We strive to present diverse content ranging from students' project details to their cultural experiences and ultimately to spread the word about what work is happening in this field, in a fun and easy-to-read format.
