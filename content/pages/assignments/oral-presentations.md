Giving confident, articulate, well organized and engaging presentations is a skill that is crucial at MIT as well in your future professional lives. Each student will give two oral presentations over the course of the term. The first presentation (15 minutes) will focus on an aspect of the writing process; students will work in teams. In addition, each student will give a brief oral "pitch" for his or her grant proposal during the last weeks of class.
